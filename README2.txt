Codes:

- Auto and Manual functions are incorporated into
one code sketch. One of the buttons of the remote
would activate the auto loop which is customizable
according to user's preference.

- Debug: Please read Tiger Manual on trouble-shooting.
	- As our functions are mapped individually and
	directly to the remote controls, function debugs
	can be carried out by toggling the individual
	controls without uploading a separate debug code.
